\chapter{Verification Through Querying}
To use our amazing model of our system, we perform a set of queries.
These queries are used to verify certain assumptions about the system, and to prove particular aspects.

\bigskip
The first aspect we want to prove it, that our system does not contain any deadlocks, which would otherwise interrupt further execution.
The query used to check this in Uppaal is \code{A[] not deadlock}, which asks \enquote{is there invariantly not a deadlock in the system}.
This query results in a \success, meaning that our system will never deadlock.

The



We use SMC so some queries can be made.


Lets inspect in simulator.
